The board is now interactive. You can click on a square in the table to prompt another table. The new table will allow you to change the
contents of the square.
Next is to populate a blank board with a sudoku puzzle.

I found generating a board was very difficult so I moved on to a the solver portion of the progrma. A sudoku puzzle can now be solved using a 
backtracking algorithm. It is quite slow as it is a brute force approach so I plan to make a new type of solver later like a stochastic 
algorithm or a human-like algorithm. 
Next is to make a function to parse the sudoku board because as of right now, it can only solve hard coded  puzzles.
