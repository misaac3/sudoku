## **So Far:**
This projects features a backtracking algorithm to solve any given sudoku puzzle. It will let you know if the puzzle is solvable or not. 
It can also generate a sudoku puzzle with the click of a button!
You can also toggle on/off the possible answers to each square giving you a little hint if you need it!

## **In the very near future:**
A genetic algorithm will be able to solve a sudoku puzzle and a human-like strategy will be implemented as well to solve them.



This project will feature a website where you can play sudoku as well as a sudoku solver.
